# Trie-data-structure-verification
This project will serve as a verification of the implementation of a Trie data structure with a set of unit tests. A Trie data structure is  a tree for fast insertion and retrieval of key-value pairs. In this context, the SUT to analyse is a variant using ternary trees.
